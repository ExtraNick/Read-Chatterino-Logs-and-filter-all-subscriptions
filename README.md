# Read-Chatterino-Logs-and-filter-all-subscriptions, gifted, and Cheers
This script uses Pandas to read twitch chat Chatterino logs and retrieves all Subscriptions, gifted subs, Cheers, and converted subs  in a .txt file.<br>

## How to use
Place your .log file generated by chatterino in the same folder as this script.<br>
Raname the .log file to "ChatLog.log"<br>

After the above is done (and assuming you are using Visual Studio Code):<br>
Select Python in the "Select Kernel option"<br>
Click "Run all" <br>

Three files will be created: <br>
1.Output contains the whole filtered log including Null rows and columns.<br>
2.ChatHistory contains all messages and users.<br>
3.TotalSubscriber contains all gifted subs, subscribers and converted subscribers.<br>

## Requirements: <br>
1. Python.<br>
2. Pandas (see https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html).<br>
3. Visual Studio Code or any environment to run Jupyter Notebook.<br>
